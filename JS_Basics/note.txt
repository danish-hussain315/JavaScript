JS is dynamically typed language 






//Type of vaiable Primitive and non Primitive 
most languages but names may vary).

🔹 Primitive Data Types

Primitives are basic, immutable (cannot be changed directly) data types.
They are stored by value (a copy is created when assigned).



Non Primitive

Non-primitives are objects, which can hold multiple values.
They are stored by reference (when assigned, both variables point to the same object).

Example
let obj1 = { name: "Ali" };
let obj2 = obj1;   // both point to the SAME object in heap

obj2.name = "Danish";

console.log(obj1.name); // "Danish"

🔹 What is String Interpolation?
String interpolation means embedding variables or expressions inside a string instead of concatenating with +.

In JavaScript, this is done with Template Literals (using backticks `).


*string comparision is case sensitive
*String Prototype will tell about the all funtion that can be apply on the String
* on apply of any funtion primitives never change the orignal variables

*Date is Object 
*Date give by system is unreadable so we uses the method to make is understandable
*Months start from 0



+++++++++++++++ Video 14  Array +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Array Takes multiple values 
* Array can store different dataTypes at same Time (Hetrogene type)
* JS array is dynamic 
* Array created shallow copy (same refference) rather than the Deep copy()
* in Deep copy we are assured that we are not changing the other copy either orignal or copy
* In Shallow copy we are ensured that when I change single other will auto changed
* there are few methods that are called Questioneer they return true ow false
  includes()
* indexOf()  indexs -1 to till index
* join() convert array values to strings and remove square brackets
* slice and splice
 slice(startindex , endIndex)
 splice(start, deleteCount, [value to insert(optional)])
* slice endIndex is not Indcluded and 
  used the deep copy when data in Array is Primitive
  used the shallow copy when data in Array is Non-Primitive


✅ Deep Copy

A deep copy creates a completely independent copy, including all nested objects/arrays.
Changing one does not affect the other.

✅ Shallow Copy

A shallow copy only copies the first level of the object/array.

If the array/object contains primitives → new values are created (safe).

If it contains objects/arrays inside → only references (pointers) are copied, so nested data is shared between original and copy.

* arr.push(array)      //consider a array as the element
* arr.concate(array )  // make a large array
+ newArray = [...arr1 , ...arr2, n]           // make a large array
* newArray.flat(level)  //reduced the level og nested arrays
* isArray(arrya)
*Array.from()     // From Converts the string to the character Array
*Array.from({name = "Danish"})        // It will return empty object
* Array.of(variables)         // creates array from variable

Global scope in node and console is different

* Global.a , Global.z



+++++++++++++++++++  Video 22 This and Arrow Function in JavaScript ++++++++++++++
* this reference to the current context
* this give in node at Global scope empty object  { } and in browser gives window, Global etc
  when we are in Node Environment
  * Just console.log(this) gives the empty object
  * in Function console.log(this)  gives lot of object that are running in node Environment
    but in arrow function this will give empty Object bC this global object
Arrow Function
* Explicit arrow Function must use of return statement and curly brackets
* rest function will called Implicit arrow Function

// Explicit Arrow Function must uses the {} and return statement
let add = (num1 , num2) => {          
  return  num1 +num2
}

console.log(add(4,14));

//Implicit Arrow Function most used in React 
let sub = (a , b) => a -b
console.log(sub(24 ,4));

// this santax is also used to return Object and arrays
let sub2Implicit = (a ,b) => (a-b)

5 patterns to use events in JS
INline li onclick="functionName" >Java</li>        // worst Practice
document.querySelector().onclick() = function Name(){}                    //better than Previous

const myElement = document.querySelector()
myElement.addEventListener(event, callBackFunction , false)

//attachEvent()         // event internet Explorer used  // obslite
// on()     // in JQuery event , JQuery was fovourite like React at that time
