ðŸ”¹ Primitive Data Types

Primitives are basic, immutable (cannot be changed directly) data types.
They are stored by value (a copy is created when assigned).



Non Primitive

Non-primitives are objects, which can hold multiple values.
They are stored by reference (when assigned, both variables point to the same object).

Example
let obj1 = { name: "Ali" };
let obj2 = obj1;   // both point to the SAME object in heap

obj2.name = "Danish";

console.log(obj1.name); // "Danish"
